### About

The project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts whether a running process is harmful to the system. By analyzing various attributes of the process, such as CPU usage, memory, and network activity, the model differentiates between benign and malicious processes. This predictive capability can be integrated into system monitoring tools for early threat detection and protection against harmful processes.

- [ ] Explore the characteristics of running processes and identify the information that can be extracted from them
- [ ] Identify a varied data source that captures typical features exhibited by malicious processes
- [ ] Conduct EDA on the dataset and uncover relationships between attributes and the potential maliciousness of a file
- [ ] Develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the harmfulness of a file by utilizing its attributes
- [ ] Incorporate and deploy this model into production for application usage
